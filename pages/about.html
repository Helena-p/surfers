                <p>We are a family owned and operated company with clear cut priorities and an ambitious mission statement.
                    Each year we raise the bar in regard to risk management, staff training, curriculum, and pure ocean fun. 
                     We make it look easy, but there is an incredible amount of work behind the scenes. We take extreme pride in what we do, 
                    and we do it for all the right reasons. Our dedication and true desire to be the best has made us the most recommended camp of our kind. 
                    Our continued dedication to leading the pack is something we are very proud of and something you can count on. 
                    Our founder has been teaching people how to surf since 1995. He has developed an amazing methodology that will get you up and riding in no time. 
                    He also understands that there is so much more to surfing then standing on a board and riding a wave. 
                    Being a surfer means being responsible to and for other surfers in the water and a dedication to taking care of our coast. 
                    That is why in all of our programs we emphasize safety, surfing etiquette, and dynamic lessons about our coastal environment. 
                    In our programs you will catch all the waves your body can stand while our expert coaches fill your mind with knowledge and your spirit with stoke. 
                    When you leave our program you will have an understanding of why surfers are surfers and why we have uncompromising 
                    commitments to coastal conservation. </p>
